# Prelude

Many thanks to my r-mentor [Eric
Anderson](https://swfsc.noaa.gov/staff.aspx?id=740) for sharing this
lesson.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF,MS Word documents and even slideshows. For more
details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document.

We are going to go through using many of the features of R Markdown
whilst writing up a recipe that can calculate appropriate quantities if
you want to increase the recipe by any factor.

First, we are going to make a subsection dedicated to grandma from whom
this recipe came.

## Dedication to grandma {#tag-it}

This recipe came from my grandmother whom I always remember used to say:

> You only get to be young once,\
> But you can stay immature forever\
> --grandma

Notice in the above that we used `>` to make a block quote and we *also*
used two spaces (which, of course, you cannot see!) at the end of each
line to force a line break.

I leave this dedication with a picture of grandma:

![A pic of grandma](figures/Warthog4.jpg)

**Holy Oversized Image Batman**! You have got to be kidding me! There
must be some way to make that image smaller. Sadly, in this dialect of
markdown, there is not a direct way to do so in the *markdown* code
itself. However, later we will see how to do it by printing the image
from within an R code block.

We might come back to this [Dedication](#tag-it) at some point, so we
have linked it to a tag. Note that it does not seem you can link to
arbitrary text, but you can to section headers.

# The Recipe

## The Ingredients (Static Version)

Let's list those ingredients for a single recipe's worth of Grandma's
Glop. We call it "static" because it applies to just a single recipe. We
will look at "automagically" doubling, or tripling, or "pi"-ing the
recipe in a [later section](#calc-quants).

### Static List version {#static-recipe-list}

You may want to notice what happens if you don't have two "returns"
(line endings), which give you at least one empty line, above the "##"'s
used to make the section header---It doesn't recognize it as a header.

Let's see, we have already seen how to make text *italic* and **bold**.
Did you notice how Rstudio highlights those bits in the text editor
window? That is called "Syntax Highlighting" and it is super helpful.

Let's write our recipe in a list. Be wary! There has to be an empty line
above the list *and* the space after the asterisk or number is important
(i.e. mandatory)!

-   2 cups flour

-   4 eggs

-   1 Pound of Grandma Gorp:

    -   0.5 pounds raisins
    -   0.5 pounds cashews

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    # you can indent R code blocks if you want them 
    # indented to pertain to list items.
    ```

Notice, the indent level is 4 spaces. You can use a `-` or a `*` or a
`+` to start those list items. In fact, you can mix and match them too,
as I did, but it is probably better to be consistent. (Use the same
symbol within a nested level and different ones between). Hey! did you
notice the backticks (upper left of your keyboard--- same key as the
tilde) around things. Those include inline code-fragments---basically
they get printed out in monospaced type (any maybe in a different
color). Super useful for variable names like `x_data` or `y_data`.

While we are at it, let's look at what I have done with the text in the
.Rmd file (the text file). Note that I have put plenty of line endings
in so that there are not big long lines. This is a good habit to get
into because git likes to look at differences between files on a line by
line basis. If the lines are long, then it is harder for git to
reasonably merge changes. Rstudio's editor will soft-wrap the lines so
that it looks like there are line breaks but there really aren't. Like
this ridiculously long line.

And do keep in mind that a blank line equates to a paragraph break.

### Static table version {#static-table-list}

We could also have written that stuff out in a table. There are actually
lots of ways to write tables. See [this
link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#tables).

| What    | How Much | Units |
|:--------|:--------:|------:|
| Flour   |    2     |  cups |
| Eggs    |    4     | eggs! |
| Raisins |   1/2    |   lbs |
| Cashews |   1/2    |   lbs |

: *Whoa! that is neat, but kind of a lot of work to input. I sure
wouldn't want to do that for a big table! We will investigate ways to
automate that. Note that the colons dictate the alignment.*

## How to make it

Once you have the ingredients, you have to prepare the meal. This is a
great task for an ordered list:

1.  Break the eggs and scramble them
2.  Grind the cashews in a food mill
3.  Eat the raisins to keep your energy up because you are going to have
    a lot of stirring to do. Notice that you can break lines in the text
    within an item, so long as you don't leave a blank line. The
    indenting makes the text source more readable but is not necessary.
4.  Add cashews to eggs, stir in flour
5.  Mix for 30 minutes.

Note that you can put whatever number you want in the front and the
markdown interpreter will figure out which numbers they should be. The
numbers must be followed by a period!

## Cooking time: It's complicated

Now, the big trick to getting grandma's glop just right is cooking it
for the proper length of time. Describing this is going to require that
we cite some literature and also that we write down some
equations...What fun! Let's see how we do that with R Markdown. Cooking
time $M$ (for minutes) decreases as the square root of the cooking
temperature $T$, but increases as the $\frac{3}{2}$-power of the
elevation $a$ (for altitude), in feet. For
$300^\circ \leq T \leq 500^\circ$ and $0\leq a \leq 5000$, cooking time
is $$
M = (20 - \sqrt{T/4}) \times \biggl(\frac{a+5000}{2500}\biggr)^\frac{3}{2}
$$ Anyone that is really interested in writing technical mathematical
documents should learn to use LaTeX directly. Thankfully, you can imbed
R code within LaTeX much as can be done with R Markdown.

We should perhaps qualify this model with a few statements. This model
was not empirically derived by rigorous tests, rather we guessed at it
given similar work done on cooking times of Chinook salmon at altitude
[@will2014] and for steelhead at different temperatures [@abadia2013].
But please bear in mind that we did not account for the issues noted by
@crandall2016 which arise while using next generation oven technology.
You can easily add citations by clicking "Addins" and "Insert Citations"

Clearly, it would be nice to have a table of cooking times, $M$, for a
few values of $T$ and $a$. Let's take $T\in\{300, 350, 400, 450, 500\}$
and $a\in\{0, 1250, 2500, 3750, 5000\}$. Holy smokes! There will be 25
rows in that table! I don't want to write that by hand!

Thankfully, we can use R to do it for us. We make a a data frame of
values, then use a nifty function `kable` from the `knitr` package to
make the table. Get ready, we are going to use some R:

```{r make-the-tam-table}
# first make the data frame
temps <- rep(seq(300,500,50), 5)
alts <- rep(seq(0, 5000, 1250), each=5)
tab <- data.frame(Temps = temps, Altitude = alts, 
                  CookTime = (20-sqrt(temps/4)) * ((alts+5000)/2500) ^ (3/2))
```

And then we print it and it looks like this

```{r kable-it, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(knitr) # requires this package
kable(tab)
```

: Cooking times, $M$, at various temperatures, $T$, and elevations, $a$. 

And we can plot this puppy.  

```{r}
ggplot(tab, mapping = aes(x = CookTime, y = Altitude, color = Temps)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red")

```

## Calculating Recipe Quantities {#calc-quants}

This could be done several ways, but let us simply look at how we would
list the ingredients.

First, make an R code block where we declare the quantities:

```{r quants}
amts <- c(Flour = 2, Eggs = 6, Raisins = 0.5, Cashews = 0.5)
mult <- 42 # make a mult-fold version of the recipe
aa <- amts * mult
```

Then access those variables inline in the list. For example: In order to
make `r mult` times the standard recipe, you will need

-   `r aa["Flour"]` cups flour

-   `r aa["Eggs"]` eggs

-   `r aa["Raisins"] + aa["Cashews"]` lbs of Grandma Gorp:

    -   `r aa["Raisins"]` lbs raisins
    -   `r aa["Cashews"]` lbs cashews

And, if you want to make $\pi$ times the standard recipe you need:

```{r, include=FALSE}
aa <- amts * pi
```

-   `r aa["Flour"]` cups flour

-   `r aa["Eggs"]` eggs

-   `r aa["Raisins"] + aa["Cashews"]` lbs of Grandma Gorp:

    -   `r aa["Raisins"]` lbs raisins
    -   `r aa["Cashews"]` lbs cashews

Of course, had we wanted to, we could have stuck that in a `kable`
table, too.

# More notes about markdown

## A note about citations and references

You can define different styles in a "CSL" file which you can put where
Rstudio can find it (in your project) and then call it out in the YAML
header. You apparently can store your citation database in many
different ways. I chose BibTeX because that is what I am used to. The
citation data base for this document is `blop.bib` which looks like
this:

```{r cat-bibfile, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, size=1}
cat(readLines("glop.bib"), sep="\n")
```

Note that by default only the citations in your data base that actually
got cited will be included in the References.

It should be pointed out that you can easily grab BibTex-formatted
citations from [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).

If you want to use a different bibliography style, browse the styles
available at [Zotero Style Repository](https://zotero.org/styles). You
can just download them and put them in your project. If we have time, we
can try using the *Science* citation style.

Much more about citations with R markdown can be found
[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
and you can find plenty of other good links at the bottom of this
[page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Making PDF and Word documents

To make a PDF document you need the TeX typesetting engine. It is free,
but many of you probably don't have it yet.

To make a Word doc, click the down triangle to the right of "Knit HTML"
and choose "Knit Word". Can you figure out what changes in the document?
(Again, it is textual and transparent!) Contrast that to the Word
document itself---do this at your Unix command prompt (in the right
directory of course):

    cat auto-recipe.docx

### Changing styles and templates

Wanna have a different look? Try the "Gear" link to the right of the
"Knit HTML" button. Notice how changes there change things in the YAML
header.

You can also check out [different YAML
themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
