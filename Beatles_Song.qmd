# Lyrics to "Across The Universe"

## From Nothing's Gonna Change Our World

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe  
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
for(chorus in 1:4){
print("Nothing's gonna change my world")
}
```

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes  
They call me on and on across the universe  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universeuniverse universe universe universe   
*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
for(chorus in 1:4){
print("Nothing's gonna change my world")
}
```

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing  
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
for(chorus in 1:4){
print("Nothing's gonna change my world")
}
```



```{r}
#| echo: false
for(chorus in 1:6){
print("Jai guru deva")
}
```
